### Final project for coursera Practical Machine Learning course


Code in index.Rmd file assumes that you have pml-training.csv and pml-testing.csv even though second file is not used for calculations.

Also, code for training model is commented purposefully as it takes a long time to finish. If someone wants to reproduce results, call to train function should be uncommented.
